# Tableau Dashboards

Compilation of the dashboards that I have designed with Tableau.

## Operation Fistula

Operation Fistula exists to end obstetric fistula for every woman everywhere.

Obstetric fistula is the physical manifestation of entrenched societal and institutional inequity.
Its persistence is a direct result of systems failing to serve women and girls . Obstetric fistula
primarily affects women in remote areas of the world, who tend to be isolated, and socially
ostracized as a result of their injury. All of this contributes to a poor level of understanding of
the condition, and a lack of data on its prevalence and incidence globally.
